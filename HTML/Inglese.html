            <p style="background-color:red; color: aliceblue;">A) Do you remember 1920s?</p>

            <p style="background-color: blue;">Ma) Of course, I was 25 years old in 1920, I remember trains to be always on time</p>

            <p style="background-color:red">A) Yes but we had very big problems</p>

            <p style="background-color: blue;">Ma) Yeah, very very big problems</p>

            <p style="background-color:red">A) It's been one of the worst decade ever</p>

            <p style="background-color: blue;">Ma) Yes, but there were few good things, for example the women's right to vote in USA </p>

            <p style="background-color:red">A) Of course, but also horrible things such as the march on Rome</p>

            <p style="background-color: blue;">Ma) Yes but it was a nice decade for USA because of the technological improvement</p>
            
            <p style="background-color:red">A) I agree, they were starting to have cars, radios and telephones </p>

            <p style="background-color: blue;">Ma) and always in USA the lifespan was starting to increase</p>

            <p style="background-color:red">A) well, all this being said, we can say that it was a very bad decade for Europe and a little better for US</p>
